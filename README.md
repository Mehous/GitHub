# Testing Framework (Recognizing 3D Trajectories as 2D Multi-stroke Gestures)

We developed this small testing framework to evaluate 3D uni-stroke uni-path single-point gesture recognizers through two quantitative measures (Recognition rate & Execution time). The framework contains seven 3D gesture recognizers extended from four 2D stroke gesture recognizers from the literature. We evaluate the recognizers on three gesture sets containing 3D trajectories in two scenarios(User-independent & User-dependent). For more details, please refer to our publication:

This repository includes the seven recognizers codes and the three gesture datasets in a unified format.
